\abstract
{

   This is the end of year report for a BSc degree project which had originally
   targeted a design of a complete wireless system for streaming of music control
   data collected from sensor devices and MIDI hardware to a host machine which
   would synthesise an audio signal to be delivered into loudspeakers or recorded
   on disk. Despite rather simple design idea, the research and development had
   taken extended time period and the emphasis of this report is on a variety of
   aspects related to wireless sensor network design and implementation. These
   aspects include: cross-platform operating system architecture, development
   hardware, application design and the abstraction layer requirements for
   interfacing hardware functions to the software as well as other miscellaneous
   subjects intersecting these areas. Two popular operating systems are presented
   in this report - \emph{Contiki} and \emph{TinyOS}. Two common microcontroller
   architectures had been used in the course of this project - 32-bit \emph{ARM}
   and 8-bit \emph{AVR}. \emph{IEEE 802.15.4} devices where considered as the
   only suitable radio harware option, due to the wide use and availability of
   the chips which implement this protocol. Another key assumption has been that
   the complice to the Internet Protocol (IP) is neccessary. A simple prototype
   has been implemented and a set of solutions proposed for a complete product
   design. Several advanced subjects for further work are also addressed in this
   report.
