\abstract
{

   This an end of year report for BSc degree project which had originally targeted
  a design of complete wireless system for streaming of music control data collected
  from sensor devices and MIDI hardware to a host machine which would synthesise an
  audio signal the delivered into loudspeakers or recorded on disk. Despite rather
  simple design idea, the research and development had taken extended time period
  and the emphasis of this report is on a variety of aspects related to wireless
  network design and implementation. These aspects include cross-platform operating
  system architecture, microcontroller development hardware, application design and
  the abstraction layer requirements, hardware interfacing for the system and the
  application software as well as other miscellaneous subjects intersecting these
  areas. Two popular operating systems are presented in this report - \emph{Contiki}
  and \emph{TinyOS}. Two microcontroller architecture had been used in the course
  of this project - 32-bit \emph{ARM} and 8-bit \emph{AVR}. \emph{IEEE 802.15.4}
  devices where considered as the only suitable radio harware option, due to the
  wide use and availability of chips which implement this protocol. Another key
  assumption is that complice to the Internet Protocol (IP) is neccessary.
