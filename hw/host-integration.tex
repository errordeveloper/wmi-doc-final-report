\section{Key System Components: \\ Specification \& Requirements} \label{sec:SPECS}

  This section outlines the specification which had been proposed
 after initial research phase has been accomplished. Diagram shown
 in figure \ref{fig:sketch1} illustrates the function blocks of the
 complete system that meets this specification, however it is now
 considered suitable only for the development system and not the
 final product design.

\subsection*{Sensor Node}

\emph{Sensor Node} is a device featuring a microcontroller chip
that contains following function blocks and peripherals:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{internal:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2.4Ghz RF transceiver,
		\item A/D converters,
		\item GPIO,
		\item SPI, and
		\item USART
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \emph{external:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item digital or analogue sensors,
		\item external connectors for MIDI,
		\item wired remote sensors, and
		\item serial port header
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The \emph{Sensor Node} runs software which consists of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{operating system:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item communication protocol stack,
		\item devices drivers, and
		\item application task management,
		\item service tasks, and
		\item the main program
	\end{itemize}
	\item \emph{bootloader:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item loads new software
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Final Product Design}

  The block diagrams in figure \ref{fig:products} briefly illustrate
 a subset of a product line suitable for a commercial solution. Some
 of the device proposed here can be used in a variety of applications
 and others are rather specific for the applications mention in the
 first part of this report.
