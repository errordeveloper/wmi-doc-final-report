\section{Motivation}

  Recent advances in low-power microcontroller and radio frequency data communications
 technology, together with enormous growth in the general purpose embedded computer
 market challenges several industries around the world. However, the music instrument
 industry haven't fully taken all the advantages of the most recent electronic devices
 and standards.
 
 Wireless sensor networks will very soon appear in numerous application areas,
 which may include practically any market (consumer, industrial, medical and many other).
 
 This project aims to implement a networked system for stage performance which uses
 wireless sensor devices as a creative user interface. Despite the title, this also
 concerns any theatrical or dance performance as well as various monitoring and
 control uses in entertainment systems.
