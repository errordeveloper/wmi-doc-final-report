\section{Motivation}

  Recent advances in low-power microcontroller and radio frequency data communications
 technology, together with enormous growth in the general purpose embedded computer
 market challenges several industries around the world. However, the music instrument
 industry haven't fully taken all the advantages of the most recent electronic devices
 and standards.
 
 Wireless sensor networks will very soon appear in numerous application areas,
 which may include practically any market (consumer, industrial, medical and many other).
 
 This project aims to implement a networked system for stage performance which uses
 wireless sensor devices as a creative user interface. Despite the title, this also
 concerns any theatrical or dance performance as well as various monitoring and
 control uses in entertainment systems.

\section{Organisation}

  The very initial research and preparation phases of this project had taken place
 prior the start of the academic year \emph{2010/11}. When the project has started
 in October, one of the first steps taken was a creation of website, which provides
 a number of important facilities for project management, file keeping and issue
 tacking. The website can be found at the URL below:
 {\URL{http://wmi.new-synth.info}}
 It will be referred to throughout this report as \emph{The WMI Website}. A current
 source code repository is also available on-line and linked to the website as well
 as work in progress notes and other supplementary information and data.
