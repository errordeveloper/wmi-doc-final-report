\section{Implementation Decisions}

  Two programs where written to test transmission of MIDI. The concept of
 server/client communication could be applied, nevertheless it had been
 found more appropriate to name the parties as a \emph{Talker} and a
 \emph{Listener}. At the time of writing of this report the \emph{Talker}
 program had been fully tested and debugged. The second program can be
 considered only as a prototype and does require further work.

  The \emph{protosocket} macros had been utilised for the implementation,
 hence the communication protocol imposed by \emph{protosocket} was TCP.
 There are various improvements that are still to be considered.
 The specification of TCP includes a notion for \emph{urgent data}
 (\RFC{0793}), however this feature has received a very limited adoption
 and is known to be handled differently by various implementations of TCP
 \cite{ietf:draft:tcpm:urgdata}. It has been found that the \emph{uIP}
 stack does implement some mechanisms for the \emph{urgent data}, however
 the documentation on how it can be applied in \Contiki\ application code,
 could not be found. 


\subsection{UDP Multicasting}

  A variety of packages exist which utilise UDP multicasting for streaming
 of the MIDI data on LAN. These include \emph{ipMIDI} \cite{links:ipmidi} for
 Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X platforms as well as compatible
 packages for Linux - \emph{multimidicast} \cite{links:multimidicast} and
 \emph{qmidinet} \cite{links:qmidinet}. This two Linux packages had been
 tested with current implementation of the \emph{Talker} program and have
 shown a suitable performance. The multicasting approach is considered to
 be quite appropriate for streaming of MIDI signals on IP networks, since
 no configuration is required, i.e. none of the participants have to set-up
 connection between each other and only need to send data to the multicast
 IP address\footnote{\emph{For compatibility with ipMIDI, the multicast IP
 address should be 225.0.0.37 and the port numbers from 21928 and above.}}.
 However the \emph{ipMIDI} is not a formal protocol, it simply streams the
 MIDI signals to a UDP socket, i.e. there are no any error correcting
 mechanisms or hand-shaking.


\subsection{MIDI Networking in Linux}

  On Linux, networking of MIDI clients can be implemented in user-space
 with \emph{ALSA ("Advanced Linux Sound Architecture")} utilities package
 \cite{links:linux:alsa}.
 The documentation on \emph{ALSA Sequencer Network} is limited to the
 comments in the source code of the \MAN{aseqnet} program. It is design
 using UDP and a specific data structure. The two programs mentioned in
 the previous section do not communicate with \MAN{aseqnet}, but use
 the \emph{ALSA Sequencer} interface directly.


\subsection{MIDI payload for Real-time Transport Protocol}

 Two relevant Internet standards had been published by the IETF in 2006:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item\emph{"RTP Payload Format for MIDI"} (\RFC{4695})
  \item\emph{An Implementation Guide for RTP MIDI} (\RFC{4696})
 \end{itemize}

 This two papers had been studied and considered as a possible solution
 for encapsulating MIDI data stream on a \emph{6loWPAN} networks, however
 the implementation would require a library for the \emph{Real-time
 Transport Protocol} as well a large set of algorithms to handle various
 aspects of the \emph{RFC4695}. It would be a very challenging task to
 design \emph{RTP-MIDI} library which could run on a microcontroller.

 This protocol is currently implemented as part of \emph{Apple CoreMidi}
 \cite{links:wiki:rtpmidi} and an open-source library exists for Linux
 \cite{links:rtpmidi}. However, there had been major adoption for the
 \emph{RTP-MIDI} in the field.
